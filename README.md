# Your first Astro website

A minimal website starter built with Astro, designed for people comfortable with basic HTML and CSS who want to learn modern web development without the complexity.

This starter is intentionally simple.

## File Structure

```
/
├── src/a
│   ├── layouts/MainLayout.astro    ← Template used by every page
│   ├── pages/                  ← Each file becomes a page (index.astro → /)
│   │   └── blog/              ← Blog posts (.md files)
│   ├── components/            ← Reusable components (Button, Card)
│   └── styles/global.css      ← All your CSS in one place
├── public/                    ← Images and static files
└── package.json              ← Project setup
```

## Getting Started

1. **Install Node.js** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if you don't have it
2. **Clone this project** and open it in your code editor
3. **Install dependencies** and start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

4. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:4321`
5. **Start editing!** Changes appear automatically in your browser

## Understanding the Code

### Astro Files (.astro)

Each Astro file has two parts:

```astro
---
// JavaScript section - runs on the server
const title = "My Page";
---

<!-- HTML section - what visitors see -->
<h1>{title}</h1>
```

### Components

Look at `src/components/Button.astro` to see how props work:

```astro
---
const { text = "Click me" } = Astro.props;
---
<button class="btn">{text}</button>
```

Use it like: `<Button text="Custom Text" />`

### Layouts

This starter has two layouts to show how they work:

- **MainLayout.astro** - Used by regular pages (home, about, blog index)
- **BlogLayout.astro** - Used by blog posts (different navigation, styling)

### Markdown Blog Posts

Files in `src/pages/blog/` become blog posts. They use the BlogLayout:

```markdown
---
layout: ../../layouts/BlogLayout.astro
title: "My Post"
date: "2024-01-15"
---

# My Post Content

Regular markdown content goes here.
```

## Quick Start Tasks

1. **Edit the homepage**: Change text in `src/pages/index.astro`
2. **Customize colors**: Edit `src/styles/global.css`
3. **Add a new page**: Create `src/pages/contact.astro`
4. **Try the components**: Use `<Button>` and `<Card>` in your pages

## Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview built site

## Things to try

Here are some ideas for making this starter your own:

**Start with the basics:**

- Change the colors in `src/styles/global.css` - pick your favorite color instead of gray
- Edit the homepage text to be about you instead of the placeholder content
- Try different fonts by changing `font-family` in the CSS
- Write a blog post about something you're interested in

**Add your own stuff:**

- Create a new page like `contact.astro` or `projects.astro`
- Add it to the navigation in `MainLayout.astro`
- Put some images in the `public/` folder and use them in your content
- Change the footer to say something else

**Play with components:**

- Look at how `Button.astro` works - it takes text as a prop
- Try making your own component, maybe for a quote or an alert box
- Use your component in multiple places to see how reusable code works

**Try different layouts:**

- Compare `MainLayout.astro` and `BlogLayout.astro` to see the differences
- Create a new page and try both layouts to see how they look
- Make your own layout for a different type of page
